# Hospitality EDA Project

## Overview
This project provides an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the hospitality industry, focusing on key performance metrics such as occupancy rates, revenue trends, and hotel performance across different cities and hotel types.

## Key Objectives
1. Analyze average occupancy rates per city.
2. Compare occupancy trends between weekdays and weekends.
3. Evaluate occupancy distribution across cities in the month of June.
4. Assess revenue realized per city.
5. Identify month-on-month revenue changes.
6. Analyze revenue distribution across different hotel types.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Data Visualization** with Matplotlib & Seaborn

## Project Structure
- `data/` - Contains raw and processed datasets.
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks with analysis steps.
- `reports/` - Summary of insights and visualizations.
